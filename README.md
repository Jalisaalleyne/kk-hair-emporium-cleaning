# Data Cleaning Scripts

This repository contains notebooks and scripts for cleaning and processing datasets, including:

- **K & K Hair Emporium_dataset**: Data cleaning notebook and processed data for the K & K Hair Emporium dataset.
- **zhaopin_dataset**: Initial data cleaning notebooks and scripts for the Zhaopin dataset.

## Structure

Each dataset folder includes raw data, cleaned outputs, and logs generated during processing.  

## Usage

Open the corresponding Jupyter notebooks to run the data cleaning workflows. Update scripts as needed to handle new data.

## Notes

- Generated files (e.g., CSVs in `*_processed` or `*_ingested` folders) should not be committed unless necessary.
- Ensure Python dependencies are installed before executing notebooks.
